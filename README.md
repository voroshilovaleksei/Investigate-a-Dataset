# Investigate-a-Dataset

For this project, I have conducted my own data analysis and created a file to share that documents my findings. I have started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I have used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. This project is open-ended in that I was not looking for one right answer.
